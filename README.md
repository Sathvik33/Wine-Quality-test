# **Wine Quality Prediction**

This project predicts the quality of wine based on various physicochemical features using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model.  
The dataset contains several parameters such as acidity, sugar content, pH, and alcohol percentage, and the model classifies the wine into quality categories.
